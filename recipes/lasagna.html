            <p>Lasagna, the beloved layered pasta dish, boasts a heritage as rich and diverse as its tantalizing flavors. Originating in ancient Greece, where flat dough sheets were combined with various fillings, it wasn't until the Romans embraced this culinary concept that lasagna truly began to take form. As the centuries unfolded, the recipe evolved and journeyed through the Mediterranean, eventually finding its way to Italy. In the heart of Emilia-Romagna, lasagna became synonymous with the region's passion for good food. The dish's popularity skyrocketed during the Renaissance, gaining favor among the Italian aristocracy. Today, lasagna has firmly established itself as a global comfort food, a timeless testament to the art of layering flavors and textures. As you embark on your own culinary adventure, remember that each forkful of lasagna carries with it a delicious piece of history and a celebration of the diverse influences that have shaped this iconic dish.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
